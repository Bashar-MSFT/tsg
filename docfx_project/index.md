The growth of Open-Source RDBMs usage provides an opportunity to increase adoption of Azure by increasing the range of engines we provide a Relational Database as a Service.
Project OrcaSQL brings the expansion of our relational database offerings by introduction of MySQL and PostgreSQL database services alongside our Azure SQL Database. In that effort we are leveraging our existing Sterling PaaS platform to host these new database services.

Azure Database for MySQL and Azure Database for PostgreSQL are relational database services in the Microsoft Cloud built for developers based on the community version of open source MySQL and PostgreSQL engines delivering:

Predictable performance at multiple service levels
Dynamic scalability with no application downtime
Built-in high availability
Data protection

All those capabilities require almost no administration, and all are provided at no additional cost. These capabilities allow our customers to focus on rapid app development and accelerating time to market, rather than allocating precious time and resources to managing virtual machines and infrastructure. In addition, customers can continue to develop applications with the open source tools and platform of choice, and deliver with the speed and efficiency their business demands without having to learn new skills.

Please use the following guidance when talking about Orcas products.
 
· When you are talking about ONLY one of the 3 products – use the full name below, depending on the database engine 
	o Azure Database for PostgreSQL
	o Azure Database for MySQL
	o Azure Database for MariaDB
			 
· When you are talking about MULTIPLE products – use the following 
	o Azure database services for PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB or a combination depending on the database engines you are talking about
	o I’ve seen usage like Azure Database for PostgreSQL and MySQL – that is incorrect both in terms of product name as well as grammar 
 
· Wherever possible use full product names like ‘Azure Database for PostgreSQL’
	 
· Please note the use of upper case and lower case letters in above cases. We use upper case ‘Database’ when we are using formal product names but lower case ‘database services’ when talking about multiple products
	
· Specifically for PostgreSQL there is a lot of confusion about the name and pronunciation. We can talk about PostgreSQL (postgres-qu-el) or Postgres, but not Postgre or PostGres or anything like that.
